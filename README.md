> Synopsis
## Season 1
A story about Boo Yong-joo (Han Suk-kyu), a triple-board certified surgeon, who was once at the top of his field and used to work at Seoul's top medical center, Geosan University Hospital. After a traumatic incident, he disappears and changes his name to Kim Sa-bu. He begins working at a small hospital named Doldam, located in Gangwon Province. He guides Kang Dong-joo (Yoo Yeon-seok) and Yoon Seo-jeong (Seo Hyun-jin) to become great doctors by teaching them to fight against power and money for the sake of patients.
### Season 2
Three years following the events of the first season, Kim Sa-bu visits Geosan University Hospital to recruit a general surgeon. He finds Seo Woo-jin (Ahn Hyo-seop), a doctor with a troubled past who is ostracized by his fellow doctors and offers him the job. In the meantime, Cha Eun-jae (Lee Sung-kyung) is suspended after making another mistake in the operation room and has no other choice but to follow the two doctors to Doldam Hospital. A doctor named Park Min-gook (Kim Joo-hun) saw this but was traumatized after seeing Kim Sa-bu again. They both got into a bus accident and saw Sa-bu risking his life helping an injured lady. He became the new chairman of Doldam only for him to be betrayed by his own team from Geosan. So, he ended up supporting Doldam and thus stayed there permanently.
### Season 3
Three years following the events of the second season, the Doldam Hospital Regional Trauma Center which was Kim Sa-bu's long-held dream will be opened. With the opening of the Regional Trauma Center, the scale of incidents and accidents that Doldam Hospital has to deal with also increased.
